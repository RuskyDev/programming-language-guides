# Python Basics

Python is a popular and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding the basics of Python is essential. In this guide, we'll cover the fundamental concepts of Python programming.

## 1. Hello, World!

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program to get a taste of Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This simple program will display "Hello, World!" on your screen. It's the first step in learning any programming language.

## 2. Variables and Data Types

In Python, you can create variables to store data. Python supports various data types, including:

- **int:** for integers (e.g., 5, -42)
- **float:** for floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)
- **str:** for strings (e.g., "Python", 'Hello')
- **bool:** for Boolean values (True or False)

Here's how you can declare variables:

```python
age = 25
name = "Alice"
is_student = True
```

## 3. Basic Operations

You can perform arithmetic operations in Python:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

# Addition
result = a + b

# Subtraction
result = a - b

# Multiplication
result = a * b

# Division
result = a / b
```

## 4. Conditional Statements

Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making:

```python
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just turned 18!")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

## 5. Loops

Python offers `for` and `while` loops for iteration:

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## 6. Functions

You can define functions to group code into reusable blocks:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

These are the basic concepts of Python programming. As you delve deeper into Python, you'll discover more advanced features and libraries that make it a powerful tool for various applications, from web development to data science. Happy coding!
